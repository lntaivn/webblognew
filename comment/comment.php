      You probably should use for this purpose instead of ServiceWorker, not
      only because it serves the purpose better, but also in spite of
      performance. Accordingly to this article, you may gain some performance
      by using ... if you send small amount of data per message. This is my
      little research, I didn't test it, so let me know if I'm wrong.
